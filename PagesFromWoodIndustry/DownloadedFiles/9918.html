Thank&nbsp;you for those taking a look at our listing. I will tell you about myself and a little on my company and what you can expect from us.<br>I started woodworking in my grandfather’s shop in North Carolina. He taught me that it was more important to take the time to have a quality job that would last than try to go quickly and fight what you were doing with the end product suffering and in the end not getting the job done any faster and definitely jeopardizing the quality. This simple fact has been a main part of the quality projects we have turned out over the years. After working with my grandfather in his shop I grew up working odd jobs of all sorts. I worked as a commercial cleaner, tile setter, concrete paver installer, and carpenter. Over those years I attained many skills to establish myself in the construction industry.<br>Woodworking:<br>I began working in an architectural millwork shop in 1997 I really enjoyed building cabinets and countertops and many custom items. It was a growing company and we had a lot of great talented guys there. I quickly worked into a manger position and was running the laminate casework line. The company had many different types of machinery including a beam saw, edgebander, cnc router and many other cabinet shop tooling. After I ran that line for a while they needed help in the installation aspect of the company and I went into the field. I first started working under some of the best styles of guys. One guy was a no nonsense approach and made lots of things happen fast. The other was a craftsman, no other word for it. So after working under them for about a six months I went and ran my own crew with the company. I did that until the company went out of business in 2001. I knew some subcontracting installers that were also working for the company that I did and they encouraged me to start installing for different companies. At that point I started Andrew’s Custom Cabinets. Later in 2004 they changed the laws on Workman’s Compensation so I changed entities to Premier Woodworking LLC.                                                                                                                                                            Premier Woodworking LLC began manufacturing and installing casework and millwork in 2004. At first we mainly focused on home builders and the residential market but soon found that we wanted to expand into the commercial construction.  We began installing commercial jobs which included installing cabinets and architectural millwork in banks, schools, courthouses, doctors’ offices and restaurants.  We now can not only install but, manufacture a good assortment of different millwork and casework items. We now have a good balance of residential and commercial jobs that we have completed and continue to work on. We do that so we can stay diversified in this market.  Premier Woodworking LLC is licensed and we have Worker’s Compensation and Liability insurance required by the State of Florida. Also, our employees and subcontractors have passed the fingerprinting registering process that allows us on school grounds when children are present. We have experience with both the manufacturer aspect and the installation aspect and are well versed with many products as your company most likely is. We are a certified manufacturer of Avonite solid surfaces and have manufactured and installed many different types of solid surface products including Corian, Gibraltar and the others brands.  Also, we have manufactured and installed various wood trim, doors, many different types of cabinets and reception desks. In addition to the manufacturing aspect we will consider subcontracting installation from other manufactures. Considering who and what the project is.<br>We would greatly appreciate the opportunity to bid any project that you are currently doing or any projects that you may have coming up in the future. My contact information is listed below and I look forward to hearing from you in the near future. Thank you for your time and consideration to use our company for your upcoming projects.<br>Andrew Guinn<br>Owner<br><br>Contact Info:<br>Cell: 386-623-3819<br>Office: 386-243-0623<br>Fax: 386-758-5963  <br>Email: andrewguinn@premierwoodworkingllc.com<br>
