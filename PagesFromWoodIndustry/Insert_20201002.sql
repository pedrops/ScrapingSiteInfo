I let my �mind�s eye� direct each project as the design evolves in order to maximize form and function. While my creative approach is intuitive, I express my creativity through physical, hands-on craftsmanship honed by years of practice that can be detected in the fine detailing of each piece.   Today, I have my own woodshop. I work alone and approach each project with the attitude of an artist. My signature woodworking traits: contrasting woods, curved legs and old school joinery techniques (mortise and tenon; and cross-lapping) and the design elements, compliment my innate artistic ability. Inspiration comes from the wood itself and my ability to transform a raw material into a functional piece of art. I strive to transform wood into elegant, clean and concise lines that will be admired by those with an eye for fine detail and those that can feel my passion for wood when they caress the surface of any piece that I create.','3563-Polk Circle E  Wellington, CO 80549 USA','970/568-6909','','http://www.woodindustry.com/cgi-bin/wwd/email_woodworker.pl?LISTING_ID=10020','http://blasemathernjr.com','Blase Mathern Jr')insert into dbo.WoodCompanies values('carr cabinet','Custom cabinets for your home, We build all wood custom kitchen and bath cabinets,furniture,window seats,and many others.

Ecoshel installs faster, performs better, lasts longer, and costs less installed than conventional shingles. As siding, Ecoshel protects the underlying structure from decay better than any other conventional siding.     Ecoshel is the first and only cedar shingle panel that uses true, full size, western red cedar shingles, and can be used for roofing as well as siding. The shingles are connected to each other, not to a backerboard. Just matching guide numbers, when starting a new course, provides a perfect installation automatically, with all joints between shingles offset at least 1.5 inches from the joints in the next two courses, as required by code. The system optimizes the position of joints to eliminate leaks even in extreme weather.     When properly installed, true shingles are exceptionally weatherproof because the overlapping layers provide multiple barriers to precipitation, with each layer redirecting water back to the surface.     While the Ecoshel System is virtually leakproof, it also provides superior ventilation that eliminates trapped moisture from other sources, such as window leaks, condensation, and solar vapor drive . Ridges on the back of the shingles provide a built in ventilated rainscreen that eliminates trapped moisture without the trouble and expense of installing a separate rainscreen system.     Choosing a rainscreen installation is an important decision. When siding is installed directly on the housewrap, solar vapor drive can force trapped moisture through the vapor permeable housewrap, causing mold and decay in the sheathing, and inside the wall. This hidden decay often determines the lifespan of the structure. Unventilated installations can result in significant levels of decay inside the walls in as little as ten years.     Ecoshel also provides ventilation between shingle layers, which prevents trapped water between shingles, and promotes drying. Shingles that can dry on both sides are less likely to warp or cup, and will last longer.','po Box 350  Atlanta, GA 30350 USA','404/229-7343','','http://www.woodindustry.com/cgi-bin/wwd/email_woodworker.pl?LISTING_ID=10273','http://www.ecoshel.com','David Fantigrossi')insert into dbo.WoodCompanies values('AntiqueFurnitureRestorationStudio.com','We are a family business using traditional methods and materials, and we aim to provide excellence in all areas of furniture restoration and conservation.

The wood we use to produce Historic Flooring products was originally harvested anywhere from 100 to 300 years ago, when it was used to build America. We rescue most of the wood from old barns, factories, cotton mills and other antique structures, many of which are Circa 1700s 1800s. The remainder is responsibly harvested Old Growth Lumber.  It''s not a floor until you say it''s a floor  Many companies have large inventories of reclaimed and old growth "flooring". This is where Historic Flooring is different. Our inventory is reclaimed and old growth lumber that only becomes flooring after we talk to you, the customer, about your project. Everyone has different needs, wants, and desires when it comes to building or remodeling their homes. We want to talk to you and find out what kind of look you have in mind. Then, and only then, is the wood milled to your specifications.  We Won''t Be Undersold  Does all of this sound expensive? We invite you to shop around and compare our prices to the competition. Our company is in the heart of Appalachia, where the wood is plentiful. Although we do travel to neighboring states to procure some of our inventories, we don''t have to go far to find the most beautiful antique, reclaimed and old growth woods. Our area is not only abundant, but diverse as well, boasting species ranging from Oak and Pine to Sassafras, Cherry, Walnut and Hickory to name a few. With a variety like this, we are confident that all of your ideas will come to life. We sell directly to you, the customer and take a personal interest in all of your project desires.

I�ve been working as a fine furniture maker for about 4 years now.  I take away much pride and enjoyment in building things the right way. Making a piece of furniture takes a lot of time, patience and concentration.  Making all the parts is an exacting process that I do a lot of by hand. This attention to detail ensures that the finished piece will last for a long time. I run a sawmill as part of my business which allows me to work with my material in log form long before it becomes a finished piece of furniture. Much of the lumber I use is from trees that came from local landowners that are responsibly managing their woods.

We use digital commerce to connect the wood products built by local craftsmen (and women) with the rest of North America. Our centralized mid-west location has saved shipping time and freight costs for many of our accounts. Our customers on the East coast and in the South have found us to be very competitively priced as well.  It started in 1994 as an idea. Why not partner with our Amish neighbors, friends & relatives by selling their unique, high quality wood products to the rest of the world and at the same time provide much needed extra income for our young family? So, we started building a mail order business (pre-ecommerce days) as a side venture. However, for various reasons, the idea was put on hold...for 20 long years.  But the dream never died!  So we launched Amish Country Woodworx (acwoodworx.com). We provide locally built quality components to Kitchen & Bath CABINET MAKERS, as well as CLOSET DESIGNERS, throughout North America. We are currently specializing in Dovetail Drawer boxes and expect to add Cabinet Doors & Drawer Fronts soon. Everything we offer is shipped directly from the craftsman''s work shop.   Simply call (574) 202-3705 or email us at sales@kountrylink.com to see how you can add value, save money, or become more efficient on the next cabinet or closet job you build. Or you can go directly to acwoodworx.com to register for detailed pricing.   Kountrylink is the registered name of our company but we are selling our DOVETAIL DRAWER BOXES exclusively as Amish Country Woodworx. We solicited the services of Mediaryte to create a digital commerce website for the dovetail drawer box project. This site features a sophisticated, photo based product builder and includes the capability of adding optional features.  It has been obvious by our customers feedback that there is much interest in doors and drawer fronts as well. Therefore, in order to better serve the many cabinet shops and closet designers throughout the United States & Canada, we plan to ADD CABINET DOORS & DRAWER FRONTS to our offering by August 2016.','11770 CR 30  Goshen, IN 46528 USA','574/202-3705','','http://www.woodindustry.com/cgi-bin/wwd/email_woodworker.pl?LISTING_ID=10773','http://www.acwoodworx.com','Jim Troyer')insert into dbo.WoodCompanies values('DesignShop','We design artwork for CNC machines.

Every product is only as good as the material used to make it. That�s why we don�t take shortcuts when it comes to choosing our wood. We start by meticulously scouring our local lumber yards to choose the highest quality boards. We choose wood with unique figure in order to showcase its natural beauty.  ABOUT US  Fletcher Woodworks was founded by a father and two sons that come from generations of craftsmen. The spark of our family''s craftsmanship comes from our great great great grandfather, Skoog, a woodworker who came to America from Sweden. His passion for creating beautiful woodwork has been passed down from generation to generation. Continuing that tradition we work together as a family to bring you not only a reliable tool but a piece of art.  Our passion for natural beauty is a big part of what makes us at Fletcher Woodworks who we are. We hand pick the best wood at local lumberyards. Years of experience help us choose the most beautifully figured grain without compromising the wood grains strength.  We understand as a business who relies on a natural resource we must be stewards of the forest. That''s why for each item sold a tree is planted by our reforestation partner, One Tree Planted.

They are bulky, odd shaped pieces that never quite have a home in my truck.  I like to keep the floor clear in case I need to move some material or a larger piece of equipment and not have to spend time moving things around to get the items in the truck. I recently upgraded to a new Ford Transit work van with a taller ceiling height. I am 6''3" and tired of banging my head on a regular basis so I decided to put a lot of thought into where I put things. I was able to pretty much find spots for everything except the sawhorses. I''ve used the metal versions, the plastic ones, the wood pre-assembled ones, etc. and none of them fit in my truck. I had one section in my truck left to build and wasn''t going to finish it until I designed some sawhorses that would literally fit in this final section of my truck like a glove!  I''ve had this idea in my head for a while, but as you know, it is not easy to find the time to do things that do not qualify as "work" activities that produce income. I finally solved the problem of where to store my sawhorses and the result was the Patent Pending SawHorsePro! The SawHorsePro comes apart easily and stores flat against the side of my truck and fits perfectly against the side of my shed or garage. I can even store them in a closet in my house, if needed. Having eliminated the need for any hardware or tools to assemble the SawHorsePro has allowed me to set it up quickly on any job. The assembly is so easy, even my girlfriend has set it up and taken it down for me at home.  It works better than any other sawhorse (or set of sawhorses) except there is much more that you can do with them. They are more stable, lighter and set-up in seconds without any tools and they store almost anywhere! They are infinitely configurable to your specific job as well. Grab a few for your job, home or truck and let me know what you think!

Utilizing a box beam design, these hollow beams are far lighter than typical beams and much easier to handle. Typical wood beams are machine made or poured into a mold using artificial materials, but Woodland Beam provides handcrafted, beams using the finest quality wood. We�re able to custom make our beams to any size, making each and every order one of a kind.   Founder of Woodland Beam, Mike Capuzzo, is a master carpenter of the southwest, and having witnessed the fragility of traditional wood beams which are prone to twisting and cracking, created the Woodland Beam Company. At Woodland Beam, we pride ourselves in our ability to craft real wood beams that offer longevity and sustainability. Our custom wood beams are designed to last a lifetime.

In addition, I also design and build Classical 18th Century Fine Furniture. When it came time to display my Fine Sports Memorabilia, I could not acquire any fine cabinets that would meet my standards of excellence and perfection. I sought a cabinet that was constructed from the finest Hardwoods of the world; namely Walnut, Cherry, or Mahogany. Much to my dismay, only an inferior secondary wood could be located-Oak.','Many questions haunted my mind. Materials are so very important so why didn''t anyone care enough to use these exquisite woods? Did anyone care enough to carefully hand select each piece of wood? After all, each board has a different grain pattern and adds much character to the finished piece. The wood sought must be solid in construction with no veneers or fake wood stains. Sadly, half-blind Dovetails were replaced by modern machinery that comprised the integrity of the piece. <pThese furniture making skills of the 18th and 19th century produced the highest quality workmanship compared to factory made cabinets. I wanted to display valuable sports memorabilia elegantly in a fine solid wood cabinet. The cabinets job was not only to house the priceless treasure but enhance it. A plastic or oak case would cheapen the look and certainly not accomplish the task at hand.<pIt became quite apparent that no one sold what I wanted, I refused to compromise! Thus, I created RANSPORTSCASES to solve my problem. I would design and create the finest customized cabinets on the market to display my most prized Sports Memorabilia Collection. Each and every board of wood would be hand selected and never compromised. Every cabinet would be handcrafted one board at a time. After all, it is the handwork that gives character and differentiates it from the simple screw and glue cabinets sold on the market today. <pPlease take the time and you will discover with awe and wonder - RANSPORTSCASES. I am quite sure that you will be pleased and wholeheartedly agree that the designs, joinery detail, and craftsmanship are what you have been dreaming of. Your dream is now about to become a reality. The search stops here! I eagerly await your call with much anticipation. I look forward to hearing from you!    <p4124 Anson Drive  Hilliard, OH 43026 USA','614/850-8813','614/850-8813','http://www.woodindustry.com/cgi-bin/wwd/email_woodworker.pl?LISTING_ID=6515','http://www.ransportscases.com','Richard Krawczyk')insert into dbo.WoodCompanies values('Alamo Woodworking','A wood working studio dedicated to devloping skills in all that are interested.

Nothing is "stock" and nothing is pre-assembled. Each item is built "from scratch" using fine hardwoods, hardwood moldings, and veneered, cabinet-grade plywood and carved and embossed embellishments to produce painted, antiqued, stained or natural finished wood of the highest quality.   Our creations are characterized by meticulous joinery, tight miter joints and quality finishes as well as a level of attention to the customer''s design specifications that is not readily available elsewhere.  While we do not employ a workroom or seamstress or produce fully upholstered or fabric-covered window cornices at this time, we do include wallpaper, fabric, and some padded fabric (inserts), embroidered fabric (inserts), and stained glass embellishments within our repertoire. We will also accept your wallpaper or fabric and use it in the making of your cornice.  But the most important of our abilities - regardless of whether it is a small jewelry box or a home entertainment center - is that of taking a client''s ideas from sketch to reality without the limitations of other so-called "custom fabricators."

Jack grew up and spent the first 30 years of his life in upstate N.Y.. He attended Syracuse University and studied at the Munson Williams Proctor Institute of Art. His interest in wood and its possibilities came at an early age when at 12 years old he made his first piece as a gift for his parents using hand tools. This feeling grew and in his later teens served an apprenticeship for 2 summers with a Master in Boston where he learned restoration and the ways of the old Masters. He has worked with wood all his life from building custom homes, custom cabinetry and custom furniture. At the age of 30 he migrated to the west where he lived in Utah and work on the Navajo Reservation, this is where he learned to appreciate the beauty of the Southwest. He was amazed at the landscape of Southern Utah and Northern Arizona. He has made Arizona his home and has lived in Arizona since the mid 80''s He has combined his early experiences of New England and his fascination of the Southwest into his work. After 40+ years he still works alone in his studio and has created many works for both professionals and families through out his journey. He invites you to look at his works and is more than happy to provide you with his available works or will meet with you to consider a commission.

The advantages of custom made cabinets lie in the quality of construction, quality of materials, and the maximization of space and functionality. Generally the cost of a custom kitchen made by us is comparable to the cost of the high end Kitchen Cabinets available at local Home Improvement Stores.    I do not see the need to break out the prices and itemize every cost involved in order to provide a quote for the job, but rather feel it is important to say what the total package will cost. There are no hidden surprises in my quotes. Your completed kitchen will cost x amount of dollars and that price is it, no extra charges for delivery, installation, drawer glides, knobs and pulls, hinges, toe kick, or any thing else that a salesman at the local Home Improvement Store may �forget to mention�. I spend a lot of time trying to make sure everything is covered BEFORE I provide a written quote, once that quote is delivered� That�s it! If I forgot to figure in the cost of something critical to make the kitchen work, I take care of it at no extra charge to you. The BOTTOM LINE is that you want a Kitchen, and if I tell you I will give you one for a certain price, then I will do my absolute best to give you exactly that.  I use the highest quality Cabinet Grade Plywood that is available. With the exception of the cabinet backs, all of the cabinet casework and shelving is �� or 18mm thick plywood. The plywood will generally have between 9 to 15 Plys depending on the species of wood involved. I do NOT use construction grade or shop grade plywood, nor will I attempt to hide particle board within the construction. I want your new cabinets to last as long as the home they are installed in.  When constructing the cabinet fronts, doors, and drawer fronts, I mill and plane all rough lumber to finish grade and then pick from the lot those boards that provide the most grain, figure, and personality to use for the doors and drawer fronts. This allows for each cabinet to have its own unique appeal, while ensuring each front maintains a visual balance with the adjacent cabinets.  I am �old school� in my approach to joinery. I use hardwood dowels, rabbits, and dadoes wherever possible. I use Titebond III Waterproof Wood Glue and big clunky pipe clamps. The over all process is slower than a factory would tolerate, but ensures lasting quality and strength in the cabinet�s joinery.  I use Blum or Salice hinges on all doors. Full extension ball bearing drawer glides on all drawers when ever possible. The finish I apply to the cabinets is AquaZAR water-based Polyurethane Varnish. This finish resists most household chemicals as well as abrasions, and is child safe when dry.  Generally speaking, an average sized 10 x12 kitchen usually takes about 3� to 4 weeks to get it to the point where appliances and countertop can be installed.   I do not charge any fee for a walkthrough and a quote, and I usually try to do all walkthroughs and quote preparations after the shop closes for the day (evenings and weekends) so as not to interfere with any production schedules I may be trying to keep.   If all of this sounds like the quality you would expect in your cabinets then we should talk.','16312 75th St KPN  Lakebay, WA 98349 USA','253/312-3996','','http://www.woodindustry.com/cgi-bin/wwd/email_woodworker.pl?LISTING_ID=8977','http://www.lcc.110mb.com','Paul Blackburn')insert into dbo.WoodCompanies values('Spring Creek Interiors, L.L.C.','We are a woman owned small business providing complete fine carpentry services to the residential, commercial, and retail communities.','268 Draft AvenuePO Box 630   Stuarts Draft, VA 24477 USA','540/337-5495','540/337-5497','http://www.woodindustry.com/cgi-bin/wwd/email_woodworker.pl?LISTING_ID=8979','http://www.springcreekinteriors.com','Steve or Jennifer')insert into dbo.WoodCompanies values('Taylor Made Custom Cabinetry','Our company specializes in the design and fabrication of all types of custom cabinetry.

I would like to introduce myself and my custom art furniture business to you . My name is Bruce Shinn and I build unique, one of a kind and very limited production furniture for the discriminating home owner, business person and art collector. My furniture is hand-crafted in my shop in a rural area of western Montana and shipped to customers around the world. All my furniture is built as functional art from only the finest materials.  My background includes over 20 years of experience working with wood and a short time working as a machinist. I also have a degree in Forest Management from the University of Montana and work as a Private Forestry Consultant, specializing in landowner assistance. Working as a professional forester and seeing the natural resource end of the wood products industry adds an appreciation and unique understanding to my woodworking.  I am very enthusiastic about designing and building unequaled pieces that will show off the natural color, texture and beauty of the wood I am using. My furniture is built using only quality materials and the finest craftsmanship to insure a lifetime (and more) of use and enjoyment. Using different woods in combinations, inlays, hand rubbed finishes, natural colors and graceful lines are attributes I like to build into my pieces.  My furniture is not built in any one style, other than under a rather broad interpretation of contemporary. I appreciate many styles of furniture and find inspiration from great masters, such as Maloof, Krenov, Nakashima, Frid, Stockdale and many other contemporary artists. Through the years my style of furniture continues to evolve as I learn new techniques and experiment with different woods. I will always be a student in my desire to create beautiful pieces in wood.  In recent years, I have expanded my wood selection to include exotic and lesser known species of wood imported from worldwide sources. Expansion of the global market place and concern over environmental issues in the tropics has made some very beautiful and interesting lesser known species of wood available to woodworkers. As a Forester I am concerned about the condition of our forests and the tropical rain forests. By staying informed on the issues and utilizing the Certified Forest Products Council resources, I am able to choose wood suppliers that favor plantation grown or sustainable yield sources. When we choose sustainable yield sources or lesser known species we help to preserve the environment in those countries from which they are exported, improve the quality of life for its inhabitants, while at the same time benefiting from the beautiful selection of woods available.  Making a life choice to live and raise my children in Montana creates some interesting challenges in running a fine furniture business. My desire to make my living creating artistic pieces in wood has and will continue to drive me towards expanding my market base throughout the Northwest. My furniture can be viewed at selected fine galleries in the West. I will continue seeking opportunities to show my work, publish my designs and expand my business.  My art furniture and cabinetwork are custom designed specifically for you. They are built for the discriminating person who appreciates the ''one of a kind'' workmanship I take pride in supplying to my customers. I encourage you to view pictures of some of my work through this web site, visit galleries where I am showing or contact me for additional information. If your home or business could be enhanced by a quality constructed, unique piece of functional art furniture, please E-Mail, write or call. We will ship world wide!!','PO Box 803  Plains, MT 59859 USA','406/826','','http://www.woodindustry.com/cgi-bin/wwd/email_woodworker.pl?LISTING_ID=9182','http://www.montanawood.com','Bruce Shinn')insert into dbo.WoodCompanies values('David M Couture Woodwright','We are a custom millwork company that specializes in custom cabinetry as well as architectural millwork in Azek.','40 Maple Street   Dover, NH 03820 USA','603/740-0384','603/740-0386','http://www.woodindustry.com/cgi-bin/wwd/email_woodworker.pl?LISTING_ID=9183','http://www.woodwright-nh.com','Denis Goupil')insert into dbo.WoodCompanies values('Middle Creek Wood Specialties LLC','Here at Middle Creek Wood Specialties we''ve been working hard to produce the finest quality mouldings and millwork backed by top notch service and a listening ear for all your needs.There is always a real person to answer the phone and all your questions.

The weight of the panels rests on the solid floor surface and compresses the weatherstripping, creating a weather-resistant seal. When you activate each handle, the panel lifts up onto its wheeled carriages, enabling it to slide easily and quietly along its track.   We do not manufacture aluminum panels with a thin interior wood veneer - our panels are manufactured out of solid wood, or wood with exterior aluminum cladding for trouble-free maintenance. We offer a raised wood track for improved weather performance, or a recessed track that is made out of stainless steel, rather than aluminum, for better durability and resistance to corrosion. We will also match your custom cladding color at no extra charge using Kynar paint, a superior finish that minimizes UV fading.   Lift & Slide View-Walls are made from quality hardwoods with optional custom features to complement your project''s design. Configure your door today and experience the seamless blending of your indoor and outdoor environments.

Since 1988 Woodworking Etc has been creating custom residential furnishings, specializing in built in cabinetry and handcrafted architectural mouldings. Some projects include bookcases, wall-units, entertainment centers, home office and computer furniture or custom designed for the clients needs. Each project is individually designed and handcrafted. Finishes can be painted stained or naturally finished wood .  The design process begins with a visit to the client''s home to view the site of installation and assess the needs of the client. Measurements are taken and design details determined. From here , a drawing and a cost estimate can be determined. Drawings from the client are helpful but not necessary. Generally there is no charge for the design and estimate.  Majority of the construction and finishing is done in the workshop. A large wall unit typically takes four to six weeks until completion. On site installation is one to two days.  All work is guarenteed. For more information or to schedule an appointment, please contact us at Woodworking Etc through one of the methods listed below.

He began to fashion these old doors into new interior doors, impressive entry doors, wood gates, ornamental shutters and more. Scott''s passion soon became his life''s work when he founded La Puerta in 1992. 	  Our mission is to produce beautiful, one-of-a-kind custom doors, rustic and contemporary furniture and accents from architectural antiques and old wood.

Key points of value to our clients are:    Original designs      Our furnishings are carefully designed to enhance the clients existing brand or identity. After spending time understanding their target audience, we work together with the design team to create pieces which intentionally communicate key points of value to their audience.    Sustainable products     We advocate the use of environmentally responsible materials and processes whenever possible in all our products. With client approval, we will manufacture any suitable furnishing from veneers harvested from certified responsibly managed forests (including FSC), substrates with no added urea formaldehyde and VOC compliant glues and finishes. We embrace sustainable practices in an effort to be an instrument of positive change thereby minimizing ours and our clients carbon footprint on the world we live.   Single source production     We embrace the approach of providing all relevant materials, components, aesthetic and functional items. This way everyone is assured the final furnishings will be produced and installed without the issues than can occur when multiple providers converge to complete a single piece of furniture. This also allows for an installation that completes in about one half the standard time because all components ship to the project site at one time.    Shorter lead times     Since most components of any given furnishing are commenced simultaneously, our lead times on individual furnishings typically run 6-8 weeks while others delivering the same level of custom furnishings average 12-16 weeks.    Simple process     Since we deal directly with the end user, we understand that they usually don�t purchase this type of furnishing often. We keep the entire process simple, provide relevant timely updates and absolutely never miss a commitment. The goal is to breed extraordinary levels of confidence early on so the client can focus on other more pressing project concerns.    Cost effective     We eliminate the unnecessary fees charged by general contractors and others. This allows any project to apply those unused funds to the actual purchase price of the furnishings, thus yield a higher quality product for virtually the same cost.   Effective interaction     With over three decades of direct involvement in large commercial projects, we interact exceedingly well with any construction team. We understand the needs of other members, offer valuable solutions to challenges and always honor our commitments knowing that ultimately the successful completion of the entire project is what is important.','2706 Rustic Woods Dr  Kingwood, TX 77345 USA','877/565-5995','832/565-1828','http://www.woodindustry.com/cgi-bin/wwd/email_woodworker.pl?LISTING_ID=9905','http://www.AcaciaOriginals.com','Kimberly Fuller')insert into dbo.WoodCompanies values('Northeast Georgia Cabinet Shop Inc.','Small family owned and operated 3rd generation cabinet shop.

I will tell you about myself and a little on my company and what you can expect from us. I started woodworking in my grandfather�s shop in North Carolina. He taught me that it was more important to take the time to have a quality job that would last than try to go quickly and fight what you were doing with the end product suffering and in the end not getting the job done any faster and definitely jeopardizing the quality. This simple fact has been a main part of the quality projects we have turned out over the years. After working with my grandfather in his shop I grew up working odd jobs of all sorts. I worked as a commercial cleaner, tile setter, concrete paver installer, and carpenter. Over those years I attained many skills to establish myself in the construction industry. Woodworking: I began working in an architectural millwork shop in 1997 I really enjoyed building cabinets and countertops and many custom items. It was a growing company and we had a lot of great talented guys there. I quickly worked into a manger position and was running the laminate casework line. The company had many different types of machinery including a beam saw, edgebander, cnc router and many other cabinet shop tooling. After I ran that line for a while they needed help in the installation aspect of the company and I went into the field. I first started working under some of the best styles of guys. One guy was a no nonsense approach and made lots of things happen fast. The other was a craftsman, no other word for it. So after working under them for about a six months I went and ran my own crew with the company. I did that until the company went out of business in 2001. I knew some subcontracting installers that were also working for the company that I did and they encouraged me to start installing for different companies. At that point I started Andrew�s Custom Cabinets. Later in 2004 they changed the laws on Workman�s Compensation so I changed entities to Premier Woodworking LLC. Premier Woodworking LLC began manufacturing and installing casework and millwork in 2004. At first we mainly focused on home builders and the residential market but soon found that we wanted to expand into the commercial construction. We began installing commercial jobs which included installing cabinets and architectural millwork in banks, schools, courthouses, doctors� offices and restaurants. We now can not only install but, manufacture a good assortment of different millwork and casework items. We now have a good balance of residential and commercial jobs that we have completed and continue to work on. We do that so we can stay diversified in this market. Premier Woodworking LLC is licensed and we have Worker�s Compensation and Liability insurance required by the State of Florida. Also, our employees and subcontractors have passed the fingerprinting registering process that allows us on school grounds when children are present. We have experience with both the manufacturer aspect and the installation aspect and are well versed with many products as your company most likely is. We are a certified manufacturer of Avonite solid surfaces and have manufactured and installed many different types of solid surface products including Corian, Gibraltar and the others brands. Also, we have manufactured and installed various wood trim, doors, many different types of cabinets and reception desks. In addition to the manufacturing aspect we will consider subcontracting installation from other manufactures. Considering who and what the project is.
